        AIChE RGIPT Student Chapter is one of the most prominent and illustrious
        student chapters of the institute. It comprises of students possessing
        expertise across technology, research and design. We strongly believe in
        the notion- "D&I (Diversity and Inclusion) for D&I (Development and
        Innovation)"along with the 3C's: COLLABORATION, COGNITION and
        COMMITMENT. Our student chapter aims to expose each of our members to
        the engineering mind-sets in both cultures and bring forth a
        multitudinous array of legacies, passions and academic interests and
        shall mean a big deal for this note-worthy cause.
